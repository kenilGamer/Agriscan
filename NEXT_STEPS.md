# Next Steps for AgriScan - Getting Real AI Integration Working

## üéØ Current Status

‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- Beautiful, responsive web interface
- Image upload and preview functionality
- Mock AI analysis with realistic results
- Professional UI/UX design
- API endpoint structure ready

üîÑ **What Needs Setup:**
- Real AI integration with Google Vision API
- Environment variables configuration
- Testing with actual plant images

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```bash
# Copy this to your .env.local file
GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=AIzaSyDixvpdZKCCXqZiYWC3BbsW1kKLfWkmUGk
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 2. Test Real AI Integration

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the application:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Upload a real plant image
   - Click "Analyze Plant"
   - Check the browser console for any errors

3. **Verify API calls:**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Upload an image and check the `/api/analyze` request
   - Look for real Google Vision API responses

### 3. Debug Common Issues

**If you get "API key not configured" error:**
- Make sure `.env.local` file exists in project root
- Restart the development server after creating the file
- Check that the API key is correct

**If you get "Google Vision API error":**
- Verify the API key has Vision API enabled
- Check Google Cloud Console for billing setup
- Ensure the API key has proper permissions

**If you get CORS errors:**
- The API should work fine locally
- For production, configure CORS in Next.js

## üîß Advanced Setup Options

### Option 1: Use OpenAI Vision API (Alternative)

If Google Vision doesn't work, you can use OpenAI:

1. **Get OpenAI API key** from https://platform.openai.com/
2. **Add to .env.local:**
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   ```
3. **The app will automatically use OpenAI instead**

### Option 2: Set Up n8n Workflow

1. **Install n8n locally:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g n8n
   n8n start
   ```

2. **Import the workflow:**
   - Open n8n at http://localhost:5678
   - Import `n8n-workflows/image-analysis-workflow.json`
   - Configure Google Vision credentials
   - Activate the workflow

3. **Add webhook URL to .env.local:**
   ```bash
   N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:5678/webhook/agriscan-analyze
   ```

## üéØ Hackathon Demo Preparation

### 1. Prepare Sample Images

Download some plant disease images for demo:
- Healthy plant images
- Diseased plant images (leaf blight, powdery mildew, etc.)
- Save them in a `demo-images/` folder

### 2. Test Different Scenarios

1. **Healthy Plant Demo:**
   - Upload a healthy plant image
   - Show "Healthy" result with 95%+ confidence

2. **Diseased Plant Demo:**
   - Upload a clearly diseased plant
   - Show specific disease detection
   - Highlight treatment recommendations

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Test with different image formats
   - Test with very large images
   - Test with non-plant images

### 3. Create Demo Script

**Opening (30 seconds):**
- "Farmers lose 20-40% of crops to diseases annually"
- "AgriScan uses AI to detect plant diseases instantly"

**Live Demo (2 minutes):**
- Upload a plant image
- Show real-time analysis
- Display results and recommendations
- Explain the technology stack

**Technical Details (1 minute):**
- Next.js frontend with modern UI
- Google Vision API for image analysis
- n8n workflow automation
- Real-time disease detection

**Impact & Future (30 seconds):**
- Help farmers save crops
- Reduce pesticide use
- Scale to millions of farmers

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### For Hackathon Demo

1. **Vercel (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Netlify:**
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Deploy automatically

3. **Local Demo:**
   - Use localhost for live demo
   - Have backup screenshots ready

### Environment Variables for Production

Set these in your deployment platform:

```bash
GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your_production_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "Module not found" errors**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Issue: API key not working**
- Check Google Cloud Console
- Enable Vision API
- Verify billing is set up

**Issue: Images not uploading**
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Ensure it's an image file
- Check browser console for errors

**Issue: Analysis not working**
- Check server logs
- Verify environment variables
- Test with smaller images first

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:3000

# Test API directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze -F "image=@test.png"

# Check environment variables
echo $GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY

# View server logs
npm run dev
```
